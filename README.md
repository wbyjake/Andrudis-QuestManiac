### Known issues:

Issue:

Infinite loading circle after completing/accepting any quest forcing you to restart after each ACCEPT/COMPLETE action with quests.



Possible cause:

This is a know BSG issue that happens in Live also: https://forum.escapefromtarkov.com/topic/157464-after-completing-a-task-i-have-to-restart-my-game/page/2/ It is caused by one of active Started quests being in invalid state. Supposedly this may occur when you have 2 or more quests getting completed at the same time, for example if you are trying to complete quests "Colleagues - Part 1", "Anesthesia" and "Rigged game" during the same raid it may (not 100% guarantied) bug out one of these quests. Obviously, the more quests you have, the more likely you may encounter this issue.



Workaround:

You need to edit your profile, go to "characters"->"pmc"->"Quests" and delete records for quests where "status": "Started" - that unfortunately will cause you to lose some progress on these quests, but should resolve this issue. Leave quests with other statuses as is, especially where "status": "Success". Be sure to backup your profile before editing!
